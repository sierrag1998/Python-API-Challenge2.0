Inside the stater_code file are 2 notebooks. 

WeatherPy2 is an anaylsis of over 600 cities and their weather data on 7/29/22. After exploring several realtionships between the weather data, the first conclusion drawn is the max temperatures of the cities tend to be higher in cities closer to the equator.

More specifically, in the Northern Hemisphere, latititude and temperature have a negative correlation. In the Southern Hemisphere, it appears latititude and temperature have a postivie correlation.

In adiition, It appears in both hempispheres, there is not a significant correlation between the latitudes of cities and their humidities.

Lastly, It appears in both hempispheres, there is not a significant correlation between the latitudes of cities and their windspeeds.

VacationPy2 first displays a gmaps heatmap based on the humidities of cities found in Weatherpy. Second, I filter through the cities and choose 6 cities that have ideal weather conditions. 

I then find a hotel in each of these cities, and map them on the humidity map created earlier. 

Inside the images folder are images of all the graphs created and saved in WeatherPy2 and screenshots of the maps created in VacationPy2.
